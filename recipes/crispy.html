        <p>Traditional crisp rice cereal treats with a caramel twist.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>cooking spray</li>
            <li>9 ounces crispy rice cereal</li>
            <li>1 (11 ounce) package caramel bits (such as Kraft®)</li>
            <li>½ cup butter</li>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package marshmallows</li>
        </ul>
    
    
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare a baking dish and a large mixing bowl with non-stick cooking spray. Pour cereal into a large mixing bowl and set next to your stove.</li>
            <li>Heat caramel bits and butter together in a large saucepan over low heat until both are melted and the mixture is smooth, about 5 minutes; add marshmallows. Continue to cook the mixture, stirring regularly, until the marshmallows are melted and the mixture is smooth, about 5 minutes; pour immediately into the middle of the cereal in the bowl and quickly stir to coat cereal completely.</li>
            <li>Spread the coated cereal into the prepared baking dish. Spray the back of a spoon with cooking spray and use it to press the cereal into an even layer. Let cereal cool completely before cutting into squares.</li>
        </ol>
